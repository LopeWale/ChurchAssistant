### Requirements:
Programming Languages: Python
Hardware: TASCAM Model 24 Mixer, compatible USB cable, multiple monitors
Libraries and APIs: SpeechRecognition (Python library), Bible API by getbible.net, screeninfo (Python library)

### Steps:

- Connect the TASCAM Model 24 Mixer to your Windows laptop using a compatible USB cable.
- Install the necessary drivers for the TASCAM Model 24 Mixer on your laptop from the TASCAM website.
Configure your laptop's audio settings to use the TASCAM mixer as an audio input.
- Install and setup the SpeechRecognition library in Python for speech-to-text conversion.
Implement a real-time speech recognition system to reduce latency. Test it extensively with various voice inputs.
- Develop a mechanism to recognize Bible verse citations from the text generated by the speech-to-text system. Consider using regular expressions or a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach for this purpose.
- Create a functionality that, given a book, chapter, and verse, fetches the text of the corresponding Bible verse using the Bible API provided by getbible.net.
- Implement a feature that takes the fetched Bible verse and displays it on a monitor, appropriately formatted.
- Install the screeninfo Python library and use it to fetch information about all connected screens.
- Add a setting or configuration option to your application that lets you specify which monitor to display the verses on.
- Adjust your verse-display feature to display verses on the chosen monitor. This may involve creating a new window on the correct monitor and displaying the verses there.
- Integrate all the features and run comprehensive tests to ensure that they all work as expected and within the desired timeframe. Debug and refine the system as needed.

### MODULES

## 1. Speech Recognition Module:
Real-Time Speech Recognition Library: A specialized library for real-time speech processing (e.g., SpeechRecognition, pocketsphinx).
Audio Interface Library: A library to interface with the TASCAM Model 24 Mixer (e.g., PyAudio).
## 2. Verse Citation Recognition Module:
Text Processing Libraries: Libraries for regular expressions (e.g., re) or Natural Language Processing (NLP) if needed (e.g., NLTK, spaCy).
## 3. Bible API Interface Module:
HTTP Request Library: A library for making HTTP requests to the getbible.net API (e.g., requests).
JSON Parsing Library: Standard JSON library for parsing API responses.
## 4. Display Module:
GUI Library: A library for creating the display window and formatting text (e.g., PyQt, Tkinter).
Screen Information Library: The screeninfo library for fetching information about connected monitors.
## 5. Configuration Module:
Configuration Management Library: A library for handling configuration files (e.g., configparser).
## 6. Test Module:
Testing Framework: A library for writing and running tests (e.g., pytest, unittest).
## 7. Utilities Module:
General Utility Libraries: Any additional libraries needed for common utility functions.

Summary of Previous Conversations:
